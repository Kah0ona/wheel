(defmacro defcommand
  "Defines a command as a named function that takes a repo and
  properties and returns an aggregate which will be committed, or a
  rejection that will be returned.

  Returns a `rejection`, an `ok` result or a `conflict`

  The metadata of the command may contain a :rill.wheel.events key,
  which will specify the types of the events that may be generated. As
  a convenience, the corresponding event functions are `declare`d
  automatically so the `defevent` statements can be written after the
  command. This usually reads a bit nicer.
