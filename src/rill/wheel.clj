  # Commands

  Commands are functions that apply new events to aggregates.

  ## Command flow

       (-> (get-some-aggregate repository id) ; 1.
           (cmd-call additional-argument)     ; 2.
           (commit!))                         ; 3.

  ### 1. Fetch aggregate

  Before calling the command, the aggregate it applies to should get
  fetched from the `repository`. In rill/wheel, this will always work
  and must be done even for aggregates that have no events applied to
  them - this will result in an `rill.wheel/empty?`
  aggregate that can be committed later.

  ### 2. Calling the command

  A command can have any number of arguments, and it's idiomatic for
  commands to take the aggregate-to-change as the first argument.

  As a matter of style, it's suggested that commands do not fetch
  other objects from the repository but are explicitly passed any
  necessary aggregates.

  #### Success

  A successful command returns an `uncommitted?` aggregate.

  #### Rejection

  A command may be rejected, in which case the command returns a
  `rejection` - meaning the request was denied for business
  reasons. Rejections are explicitly constructed in the `defcommand`
  body by the application writer.

  It's typically useless to retry a rejected command.

  ### 3. Committing results

  The result of a command can be persisted back to the repository by
  calling `commit!`. If `commit!` is passed a `rejection` it will
  return it. Otherwise the argument should be an aggregate that will
  be persisted.

  ### ok

  A successful commit returns an `ok?` object describing the committed
  events and aggregate.

  ### conflict

  Committing an updated aggregate can return a `conflict`, meaning
  there were changes to the aggregate in the repository in the time
  between fetching the aggregate and calling `commit!`.

  Depending on the use case, it may be useful to update the aggregate
  and retry a conflicted command.

  ## Defining commands

       (defaggregate x                                 ; 1.
         [id])

       (defevent x-happened                            ; 2.
          \"X happened to obj\"
          [obj arg1]
          (assoc obj :a arg1))

       (defcommand do-x ::x                            ; 3.
          \"Make X happen to obj\"
          [obj arg1]
          (if (= (:a obj) arg1))                       ; 4.
              (rejection obj \"Arg already applied\")
              (x-happened obj)))                       ; 5.


  ### 1. Define the aggregate type

  ### 2. Define events to apply

  Commands can only affect aggregates by applying events to them. Here
  we define an event with `defevent`. When the `x-happened` event is
  applied it will set key `:a` of aggregate `obj`.

  It's idiomatic to give events a past-tense name, to indicate that
  the event happened and cannot be rejected.

  ### 3. Define command

  Commands are defined by calling `defcommand`, specifying a name,
  aggregate type, optional docstring, argument vector and a command
  body.

  ### 4. Test state and reject command

  Aggregate state is typically only used to keep track of information
  that must be used to validate commands. When a command must not
  proceed, the command body can return a `rejection` with a reason.

  ### 5. Apply new event(s)

  When the command is acceptable, it should apply the necessary events
  to the aggregate and return the result (the updated aggregate).

  ## Alternative command invocations

  `defcommand` installs a number of functions and multi-methods that
  can be used to invoke the defined command.

  In the following examples, we assume the following definitions:


       (ns user
          (:require [rill.wheel :as aggregate
                                          :refer [defaggregate
                                                  defcommand
                                                  defevent
                                                  transact!
                                                  ok?]]))

       (defaggregate user
          [user-id])

       (defevent registered ::user
          [user name])

       (defcommand register ::user
          [user name]
          (registered user name))

  ### Commands as data

  If you need to, you can describe and execute any command defined
  with `defcommand` as a message. The commands are implemented as maps
  with a `rill.message/type` key indicating the command type with a
  qualified keyword.

  #### Command constructor

  For every `(defcommand cmd-name ...)` definition, a constructor
  function named `->cmd-name` is created that will create a valid
  rill.wheel command message:

      (->register \"my-id\" \"Some Name\")

      => {:rill.message/type :user/register,
          :user-id \"my-id\",
          :name \"Some Name\"}

  Note that the ->register function also takes the identifying
  properties of the `user` aggregate. This is required so that the
  correct `user` aggregate can be fetched from the repository.

  #### `transact!`

  You can run the given command message directly into the repository
  using `transact!`. This will fetch the aggregate using the installed
  `fetch-aggregate` multi-method, calls `apply-command` and `commit!`
  the result.

      (ok? (transact! repository
                      (->register \"my-id\"
                                  \"Some Name\")))

      => true

  If your commands are invoked from some remote source (like a
  single-page application - see the `mpare-net/weir` project), these
  are the semantics you probably want (excluding authentication etc).

  #### `apply-command`

  The apply-command is used by `transact!` and takes the aggregate to
  update and the command message and executes the `defcommand` body.

       (-> (get-user repo my-id)
           (apply-command (->register my-id my-name)))

  #### `fetch-aggregate`

  Also used by `transact!`, this method takes the repository and the
  command message and returns the aggregate the command should be
  applied to.

  ### Commands as functions

  It's convenient to be able to call commands directly as regular
  names functions. For this purpose there are two flavors:

  #### `command-name!`

  A generated function named after the command with an exclamation
  mark added. Takes the repository and all arguments to identify the
  aggregate and other command options, and commits the result.

       (ok? (register! repository \"user-id\" \"Some Name\"))

       => true

  #### `command-name`

  Another generated function that takes the aggregate as the first
  argument and the additional command arguments and applies the
  command to the aggregate. This does not commit and returns the
  updated aggregate or a rejection. You can chain successful calls
  to named command functions and `commit!` the result.

       (ok? (-> repository
              (get-user \"user-id\")
              (register \"Some Name\")
              (commit!)))

       => true

  first repository argument and retrieves the aggregate.

  events? and commands? are sequences of event specs and command specs
  and passed to `defevent` and `rill.wheel/defcommand`
