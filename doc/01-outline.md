# Conceptual Overview

Welcome to the manual of `Wheel`, a library for building Event
Sourcing systems.

This manual is intended for people who want to build an Event Sourcing
system and need to get a good overview of what `Wheel` provides.

Since Event Sourcing may not be a familiar architecture, and because
some of the design choices that `Wheel` makes may be different from
what's expected coming from other Event Sourcing libraries, we want to
describe the concepts in very general terms first, so that readers
will get a reasonable understanding of the mechanisms and trade-offs
involved.

## Command/Query responsibility separation

Rill/Wheel is built assuming a
[CQRS-style](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) separation
between the Query (read) side and Command (write) side of an
application, where state updates on the query side are completely
determined by events from the Event Store, and the command side is
responsible for generating new events.

The `Wheel` library contains tools for implementing the Command side
of a CQRS system using Event Sourcing. `Wheel` builds on top of
`Rill`, where `Rill` provides protocols and implementations of Event
Stores and messages.

## Storing state as events: streams and consistency

In an Event Sourcing system, the source of truth is the append-only
log of domain events, as committed in the Event Store. Events are
messages that describe things that happened in the domain. In an Event
Store, events are committed to a particular stream, which is similar
to a *topic* in other message-based systems.

Consistency is provided by serializing commits to a stream; every
event stream has a version, which is incremented every time events are
committed to the stream. When a new set of events is committed to the
stream, an expected version number can be provided, ensuring that the
commit will only be accepted if the stream has not changed (i.e. no
events were added to the stream since the new events were prepared).

    Execute command:
      Prepare state:
        Fetch Events from Stream
        Apply Events to State, setting StateVersion
      Generate NewEvents based on State or return {Rejection}
      Commit NewEvents to Stream when StreamVersion == StateVersion ; atomic
      Return {Ok, Events} or {Conflict}

*Pseudocode describing consistency mechanism. Note that the Commit
 with version check is an atomic operation*

## Generating events: commands and aggregates

In `Wheel`, state changes (new events) are generated by commands via
aggregates. Aggregates are reductions of an event stream that describe
the state of an event stream that is necessary to generate new
events.

An aggregate is an entity with an identity mapped to the stream
identifier, some state generated by applying the events in the stream
to the aggregate, and a version number which is the number of events
committed.

![Commands](commands.svg)

Commands are functions that take an aggregate and apply new events to
it. The process is described in detail in [[rill.wheel]].
